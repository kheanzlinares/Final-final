                <h3>Solar panels</h3>
                <p>Solar panels works by allowing photons or particles to knock electrons 
                free from atoms, generating a flow of electricity. The solar panels are actually made of smaller units called photovoltaic cells. There are many cells that are linked together to make solar panels. These cells work together to establish electricity field which occurs when opposite charges are separated. When a photon f sunlight knocks an electron free, the electric field will push that electron out of the silicon junction. Hence, a couple of other components of the cell turn these electrons into usable power.</p>

                <h3>Charge controller</h3>
                <p>Charge Controller is essentially a solar battery charger connected between the solar panels and battery. It is a voltage and/or current regulator to keep batteries from overcharging. If there is no regulation the batteries will be damaged from overcharging. Modern charge controllers have advanced features to ensure the battery system is charged precisely and efficiently . As a basic guide, the solar array should be able to generate close to, but not exceed, the charge current o the controller, which should be sized correctly to match the battery.</p>

                <h3>Battery system</h3>
                <p>Battery system works by storing energy produced by the solar panels for later use. In some cases, solar batteries have their own inverter and offer integrated energy conversion. The higher your battery's capacity, the more solar energy it can store. What this means in practical terms is that homes with solar-plus-storage can store excess solar power onsite for use later when the sun isn’t shining. As a bonus, since solar batteries store energy at your home, they also offer short-term backup power in the event that there’s a power outage in your area.</p>

                <h3>DC power</h3>
                <p>DC power - Solar panels use the photons produced by sunlight to generate direct current (DC) electricity. When the photons hit the panel they are absorbed by the panel's semiconducting silicon material. ... This movement of the electrons is what generates Direct Current (DC) electricity. A solar inverter converts the DC (Direct Current) output of a PV solar panel into a utility frequency AC (alternating current) that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid (or) used by a local, off-line electrical n/w. In this proposed system, the solar energy is stored in the battery from PV cells.</p>

                <h3>Inverter</h3>
                <p>Inverter - The basic function of an inverter is to convert the direct current (DC) power that solar panels create to alternating current (AC) power that is usable in homes and businesses or fed directly into the grid in front-of-the-meter projects (utility-scale solar arrays). Inverters are responsible for continuously tracking the solar array’s voltage to identify the maximum power at which the modules can operate, according to PVEL. If shading occurs from environmental factors or if modules are degraded, the inverter can accidentally identify the wrong peak in the string, thus reducing the overall energy production of the system.</p>

                <h3>AC power</h3>
                <p>Alternating current is the form of electricity, businesses and households are supplied with, therefore the DC power of a solar panel must be converted into usable AC power using a solar inverter. So called AC solar panels or plug-and-play panels are a recent trend in the industry and are basically DC solar panels with integrated micro inverters. Even though not widespread yet, the technical advantages of micro-inverters are a serious threat to the classical string and central inverters. The advantage with those AC solar panels is their flexible installation, handling and easy of replacement in case of defects.</p>
